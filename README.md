# SmokersCollabFilter
Personalized smoking recommendations based on Collaborative Filtering.

"SmokersCollabFilter is a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system project focused on analyzing smoking habits and providing personalized recommendations. The system leverages item-item collaborative filtering techniques to identify similarities between users based on their smoking history and preferences. By analyzing past smoking behaviors and user responses from questionnaires, the system generates recommendations for alternative smoking products, cessation programs, and related resources. This project aims to offer insights into smoking patterns and assist users in making informed decisions towards healthier smoking habits."
